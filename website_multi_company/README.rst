====================
 Real Multi Website
====================

Allows to set up multi-website and handles requests in a different company context. Later is especially useful for eCommerce to make orders for a different companies.

Odoo is designed to switch website by host name, but this feature is not completed and not supported. This module fills the gap.

Implementation
==============

Websites
--------

To work with ``website`` model, the module adds menu ``Website Admin >> Configuration >> Websites``.

To have unique home page per each website, the module makes duplicates of ``website.homepage``, e.g. ``website.homepage2`` for company #2.

To fix company logo (left side of top menu), the url is updated from ``/logo.png`` to ``/logo.png?company=ID``.

Website Menus
-------------

To easy work with ``website.menu`` model, the module adds menu ``Website Admin >> Configuration >> Website Menus`` and adds form view.

eCommerce
---------

Updates for eCommerce:

* ``/shop/*`` pages show only products for current company

Roadmap
=======

* TODO: Create website.theme record automatically after theme installation (probably via inheriting ``button_install`` method)
